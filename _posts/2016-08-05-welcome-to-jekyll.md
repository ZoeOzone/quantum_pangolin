By the bald myopy he seizes me and I thought he would slit my throat or my tendons. hold still. Then he makes five slashes one at a time from flannel starfish and trying makes it go sideways like broiling an orchid your life is a jade shaped like a bird so burn a hole in the floorboards without these words they will not stand the threshing of unmet stones you ruin a perfect metaphor with one grain of doubt every other evening you wake mid-sentence into a daymare &throttle your clover &this brook force of anthem streaming from your mane to touch me without a body your heart feels better tracing contours my skin than anyone walking my streets. my whole being glows with you. what is that noise? everything you cant see. can you make it stop? ask it. does it listen? if you close your eyes in my fucking sleep. your dandelion wish little parasol return one growing there leaden your heart husk away blown spine by red stem fell my requiem for a squall desolate and skeletal plum locust razed without her kind word a sip of mercury only how do I say this in plain words? I was dying this morning until you gave word with honey already smashing my knee against the table corner beyond resilient both of us it’s just I was gonna crash down hard and become a shadow of a bird retreat into a sanctuary of burrowing napalm to say it right is like stripping off thigh highs soaked in superglue way beyond suicide what loss? you don’t lose your body when you burn alive what happens is your joy turns to stone and i was getting ready to go swimming to feel my weak ankle flutter in the current to kick soft to flex fearless of cruel sidewalks. she scurries all the butterflies back in the jar. screw the rain. we seek for things beyond us to entertain when all can be found within.
